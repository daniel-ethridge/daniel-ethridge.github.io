description: Video Game Prototype Exploring Anterograde Amnesia
---

I developed a prototype of a metroidvania-style game called Anteronesia (a portmanteau of anterograde and amnesia) to serve as my final project for two classes during the last semester of my master's degree. 
The two classes were "Game Design" and "Computer Music Composition". I developed the game entirely using Unity, and I composed original music for it. 
The game had to be created with at least one resource as an integral part, so I chose memory as my resource which fit perfectly with the amnesia theme. In the game,  
memory allows a player to heal themselves, but it also cannot be allowed to run out. Running out of memory causes the player to lose their sanity, eventually killing them. 
This effectively means that memory serves as both health and as a way to heal.				

Check out the video below for a demo!

Anteronesia Music
===
The pieces below make up the sound track to 'Anteronesia'. They represent four different sections of the game. The main theme is the first piece to play upon starting the game. 
The "Village Theme" and the "Forest Theme" both represent the two main areas within the game. Finally, the "Fight Music" plays during the boss fight in the game against Tericken!
Check out the pieces below. (Note that for some reason, the links may not work on mobile. Use a desktop computer if you're having issues.)
