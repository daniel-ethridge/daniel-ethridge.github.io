description: Video Game Prototype Exploring Anterograde Amnesia
---

For a game design class in my final semester, I developed a prototype of a metroidvania type game called Anteronesia. The name is a portmanteau of the words anterograde and amnesia. 

The video game was developed entirely in Unity. I composed original music for it (see my "Music and Multimedia" projects for more info on the music!), and coded everything from the character controls to the enemy AI. 

Check out the video below for a demo!

Anteronesia Music
===
The pieces below make up the sound track to 'Anteronesia'. They represent four different sections of the game. The main theme is the first piece to play upon starting the game. 
The "Village Theme" and the "Forest Theme" both represent the two main areas within the game. Finally, the "Fight Music" plays during the boss fight in the game against Tericken!
Check out the pieces below. (Note that for some reason, the links may not work on mobile. Use a desktop computer if you're having issues.)
