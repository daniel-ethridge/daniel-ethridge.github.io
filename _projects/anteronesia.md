title: <i>Anteronesia</i>
description: Video Game Prototype Exploring Anterograde Amnesia
---

I developed a prototype of a metroidvania-style game called <i>Anteronesia</i> (a portmanteau of anterograde and 
amnesia) to serve as my final project for two classes during the last semester of my master's degree. 
The two classes were "Game Design" and "Computer Music Composition". I developed the game entirely within 
Unity, and I composed all original music for it using Ableton Live. 

While Unity has a built in audio engine, 
it is not strong or flexible enough for what I wanted to acheive musically. I wanted the music to change 
according to the character's state in the game as a way to give the player an auditory cue of how he/she/they
are currently doing in the game. As the player's health begins to drop, the higher freuquencies begin to be
filtered out of the audio. Additionally, an eerie melody begins to play louder and louder reminding them that
death could be near.

As per the class assignment, the game had to be developed using at least once resource to serve as the core of a
resource mangament system. I chose memory as this resource which fits perfectly with the amnesia theme. 
As the player moves through the world, he/she/they can collect memories that are scattered throughout.
This memory is what the player can use to heal themselves. With more development time, I would
have loved to also have memory be a second currency in the game (alongside regulary money) as well as play a
role in a spellcasting system.

<i>Anteronesia</i> Music
===
The pieces below make up the sound track to <i>Anteronesia</i>. They represent four different sections of the 
game. The main theme is the first piece to play upon starting the game. The "Village Theme" and the "Forest 
Theme" both represent the two main areas within the game. Finally, the "Fight Music" plays during the boss
fight in the game against Tericken! Check out the pieces below. (Note that for some reason, the links may not
