description: Video Game Prototype Exploring Anterograde Amnesia
---

I developed a prototype of a metroidvania-style game called Anteronesia (a portmanteau of anterograde and 
amnesia) to serve as my final project for two classes during the last semester of my master's degree. 
The two classes were "Game Design" and "Computer Music Composition". I developed the game entirely within 
Unity, and I composed all original music for it using Ableton Live. While Unity has a built in audio engine, 
it is not strong or flexible enough for what I wanted to acheive musically. I wanted the music to change 
depending on the character's state in the game as a way to give the player an auditory cue of how The game 
had to be created with at least one resource as an integral part, so I chose memory as my resource which fit
perfectly with the amnesia theme. In the game, memory allows a player to heal themselves, but it also cannot
be allowed to run out. Running out of memory causes the player to lose their sanity, eventually killing them. 
This effectively means that memory serves as both health and as a way to heal.

Anteronesia Music
===
The pieces below make up the sound track to 'Anteronesia'. They represent four different sections of the 
game. The main theme is the first piece to play upon starting the game. The "Village Theme" and the "Forest 
Theme" both represent the two main areas within the game. Finally, the "Fight Music" plays during the boss
fight in the game against Tericken! Check out the pieces below. (Note that for some reason, the links may not
work on mobile. Use a desktop computer if you're having issues.)
