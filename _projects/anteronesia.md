description: Video Game Prototype Exploring Anterograde Amnesia
---

For a game design class in my final semester, I developed a prototype of a metroidvania type game called Anteronesia. The name is a portmanteau of the words anterograde and amnesia. 

The video game was developed entirely in Unity. I composed original music for it (see my "Music and Multimedia" projects for more info on the music!), and coded everything from the character controls to the enemy AI. 

Check out the video below for a demo!
