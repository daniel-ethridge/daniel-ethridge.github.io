### C++ Application Development ###

I was lead software engineer on a multi-million dollar project from February 2022 to May 2023. This project uses the Qt
framework as a foundation. The backend is written in C++, and the front end is written in QML. Tasks included:

* Budgeting and delegating tasks.
* Designing the entire software architecture (front end and back end).
* Designing and implementing the GUI.
* Designing the build system using CMake.
* Designing and writing unit tests using CTest to ensure software stability.
* Writing software that communicates with hardware via socket connections.

### Vehicle Engine Identification with Python ###

During my first year with GTRI, I worked on a project aimed at classifying vehicles based soley on their engine sounds.
We used Python exclusively for this project. My tasks included:

* Researching music information retrieval techniques to learn about potential methodologies to use.
* Research into machine learning architectures such as support vector machines and convolutional neural networks.
* Implementing a modular and configurable audio processing pipeline in Python.
* Implementing a variational autoencoder to experiement with sound generation.
* Planning and execution of a field recording day to collect data.

### Front End Development with React ###

My role for this project was to create a visualization of objects on a map using Javascript and React. 
My tasks included:

* Utilizing React to create a front end environment that could listen to and send messages to a python script.
* Incorportate OpenLayers for its mapping capabilities. 
* Create custom React components that could be used wherever they were needed.
