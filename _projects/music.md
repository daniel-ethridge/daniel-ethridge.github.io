*Perspectrum*
===
*Perspectrum* was a group multimedia project completed by me and three others in my Computer Music Composition class during my master's degree. 

The work focuses on the fact that so many people in the world are discriminated against, disliked, and hated simply because of sexual orientation, race, or some other uncontrollable identifying feature. Rather than promoting this negativity, we wanted to convey that it is easier to sideline hate and that it benefits not only the victim but also the perpetrator to be kind. We envisioned this piece as the journey that someone full of hate can take to realize that diversity in the world is ok and to learn to be generous to those with differences. We wanted the audience to walk away with the feeling that learning to make a choice to be kind creates an easier life and a clearer mind.

The candles and movement seen in the video are actively changing what you hear. We utilized OSC messages and photosensor data in order to map the visual symbolism of movement and candles to sound.

Note that while the audio may seem to be noisy or have static at times, this was intentional. The message is not a light-hearted one, and the noisy parts of the audio help to reflect that.

*Can't Complain*
===
With lyrics written by my childhood best friend, I wrote the music to *Can't Complain* in the fall of 2019. It served as the final group project of my Recording and Mixing course during my master's degree at Georgia Tech. We recruited musicians to record, recorded ourselves (I'm playing piano in this), and fully edited and mixed the song from start to finish.

*Perseverance in Chaos*
===
I composed this instrumental piece in the spring of 2021. Most of the parts are MIDI instruments, but the ethereal-sounding vocals that are present every now and then are me. Written with Ableton Live, I took advantage of Max for Live for this, so there is an accompanying Max/MSP patch that goes with this and controls the background effects heard throughout the piece.
