Anteronesia Music
===
*Anteronesia* is a prototype of a metroidvania style video game that I designed and built from scratch. The game itself served as the final project for my Game Studio course during my master's degree, while the music in the game served as my final project for Computer Music Composition. (See my *Anteronesia* project page for more information about the game itself.)

There are four pieces of music for the game: the main/title theme, the village theme, the forest theme, and fight music. The piece of music that plays is determined by where the character is inside of the game, and they all (except the title theme) slightly change depending on the amount of health the player has. A motif that represents the player's approach to death plays louder when the player is low on health.

Check out the pieces below. (Note that for some reason, the links may not work on mobile. Use a desktop computer if you're having issues.)

*Perspectrum*
===
*Perspectrum* was a group multimedia project completed by me and three others in my Computer Music Composition class during my master's degree. 

The work focuses on the fact that so many people in the world are discriminated against, disliked, and hated simply because of sexual orientation, race, or some other uncontrollable identifying feature of themselves. Rather than promoting this negativity, we wanted to convey that it is easier to sideline hate and that it benefits not only the victim but also the perpetrator to be kind. We envisioned this piece as the journey that someone full of hate can take to realize that diversity in the world is ok and to learn to be generous to those with differences. We wanted the audience to walk away with the feeling that learning to make a choice to be kind creates an easier life and a clearer mind.

Note that while the audio may seem to be noisy or have static at times, this was intentional. The message is not a light-hearted one, and the noisy parts of the audio help to reflect that.

*Can't Complain*
===
With lyrics written by my childhood best friend, I wrote the music to *Can't Complain* in the fall of 2019. It served as the final group project of my Recording and Mixing course during my master's degree at Georgia Tech. In the group, we recruited musicians to record, recorded ourselves (I'm playing piano in this), and fully edited and mixed the song from start to finish.

*Perseverance in Chaos*
===
I composed this instrumental piece in the spring of 2021. Most of the parts are MIDI instruments, though there are ethereal-sounding vocals that are present every now and then. Written with Ableton Live, I took advantage of Max for Live for this, so there is an accompanying Max/MSP patch that goes with this and controls the background effects heard throughout the piece.
