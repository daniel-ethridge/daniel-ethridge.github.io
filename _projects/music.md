Anteronesia Music
===

Anteronesia is a prototype of a metroidvania style video game that I designed and built from scratch. The game itself served as the final project for my Game Studio course during my master's degree, while the music in the game served as my final project for Computer Music Composition. (See my "Anteronesia project for more information about the game itself.)

There are four pieces of music for the game: the main/title theme, the village theme, the forest theme, and fight music. The piece of music that plays is determined by where the character is inside of the game, and they all (except the title theme) slightly change depending on the amount of health the player has. A motif that represents the player's approach to death plays louder when the player is low on health.

Check out the pieces below. (Note that for some reason, the links may not work on mobile. Use a desktop computer if you're having issues.)

Perspectrum 
===

Perspectrum was a group multimedia project completed by me and three others in my Computer Music Composition class during my master's degree. 

The work focuses on the fact that so many people in the world are discriminated against, disliked, and hated simply because of sexual orientation, race, or some other uncontrollable identifying feature of themselves. Rather than promoting this negativity, we wanted to convey that it is easier to sideline hate and that it benefits not only the victim but also the perpetrator to be kind. We envisioned this piece as the journey that someone full of hate can take to realize that diversity in the world is ok and to learn to be generous to those with differences. We wanted the audience to walk away with the feeling that learning to make a choice to be kind creates an easier life and a clearer mind.
