Anteronesia Music
===========

Anteronesia is a prototype of a metroidvania style video game that I designed and built from scratch. The game itself served as the final project for my Game Studio course during my master's degree, while the music in the game served as my final project for Computer Music Composition. (See my "Anteronesia project for more information about the game itself.)

There are four pieces of music for the game: the main/title theme, the village theme, the forest theme, and fight music. The piece of music that plays is determined by where the character is inside of the game, and they all (except the title theme) slightly change depending on the amount of health the player has. A motif that represents the player's approach to death plays louder when the player is low on health.

Check out the pieces below.
