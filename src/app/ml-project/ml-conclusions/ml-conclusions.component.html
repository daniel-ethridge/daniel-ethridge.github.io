    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Conclusions</h1>

    <p>
        The ubiquity of music in society is only growing. Especially nowadays after the Covid-19 pandemic, people are eager to attend music festivals and concert, people are streaming music more and more each year, and the technology and business of the music industry continues to grow. This project strove to explore the facets of what makes a successful song based on audio features. While the original idea did not work because of school semester time constraints, actionable results and interesting information are still present.

        From the correlation search using the Last.Fm tags, the familiar gender divide in the music industry showed itself. Male singers were associated more with heavier genres like rock while female singers were more associated with lighter genres like RnB and singer-songwriter music. Historically, female singers have had a harder time making a name for themselves in these heavier genres. We have bands like ACDC, Metallica, and Black Sabbath, all with male lead singers, and through much of the second half of the 20th century, that was common. The correlation results tell the same story with male vocalists as more closely associated with the labels 60s, 70s, and 80s. The tide is turning, however, as bands with frontwomen are more and more commonplace. The Pretty Reckless, Evanescence, and Yours Truly, to name a few.

        Pertaining to the question of success, the question of music novelty became a theme through the project. It first showed itself as potentially lurking in the tidy groups formed by the Spotify feature data. Why do most songs share a small tempo range or a small loudness range? Why are most songs bordering on energetic? Why do songs gravitate towards a certain level of danceability? These questions currently do not have clear answers, but postulating on the answers leads us to the question of music novelty. It is worth noting that sampling bias may be present in the Spotify data. The songs in the dataset are most likely more popular than not, and so, if we accept that assumption to be true, then we have ideas about what at least moderately successful music looks like. It is relatively danceable, high-ish energy, has a moderate tempo, and falls pretty neatly into a designated loudness range. Anything drastically oustide of that might have a harder time finding a large audience.

        Again, returning to the idea of musical novelty, many musicians and scholars alike have noted this similarity across music. Many people have claimed that all pop music is beginning to sound the same. Others even go as far to claim that the Billboard Hot 100's most successful artist, Taylor Swift, is unoriginal. But how can that be given that her Eras tour by some metrics was the largest tour in music history? She is undoubtedly a talented musician and singer with a die-hard fan base, but how much of that fan base is due to loving Taylor Swift and how much is due to her songs being the best in the world? Some claim that she is an excellent story telling and songwriter with talent not matched by many, while others would strongly disagree. Other artists are not free from this type of scrutiny either, and the band Axis of Awesome developed their most famous hit simply by mocking the unoriginality of bands' chord choices in songs. <br><br>

        Unoriginal or not, the songs they mock are incredibly popular which indicates that they follow a formula that simply works. It could be that there is no real need to deviate from that status quo. Unoriginal or not, that is the music that people continue to listen to. 

    <p>
        Using large models and data science techniques, we can glean answers to various questions about the music industry and what it takes to succeed. While the direction the project took was not the original direction, the results still offer some insight and could provide guidance to a young, naive musician looking to make it big. Future directions for this include a more thorough methodology and attempt at integrating the different datasets together. Alternatively, there are other various ways that success could be measured. Those would be worth exploring as well.
