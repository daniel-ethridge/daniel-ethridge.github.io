        What does it take to make it onto the <i>Billboard Top 100</i>?
    </h1>

    <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
    <p>
        Millions of people in the world consume to music every day in both digital formats and live. The music industry's revenue was reported to be $28.6 billion at the beginning of 2024<app-footnote [pageRoute]="pageRoute" [id]="1"/>. It is an obvious and ubiquitous part of life, and advancements in the internet and social media are making it easier for both fans to access music and for artists to grow their fanbases<app-footnote [id]="2" [pageRoute]="pageRoute"/>. For artists, a common dream is often for a song to go viral which can lead to opportunities to transform a simple hobby into a music career. This is, of course, easier said than done. A quick google search for "what makes a viral song" returned a Medium.com article<app-footnote [id]="3" [pageRoute]="pageRoute"/> that lists "catchiness and relatability", "platform optimization", "emotional or cultural resonance", and "quality and production" as four keys. The author also lists TikTok and Spotify as critical for acheiving virality. Another online article<app-footnote [pageRoute]="pageRoute" [id]="4"/> lists marketing, simplicity, and sharability as important factors. The list of articles that describe how to make viral music is endless, but most likely none of them use any kind of scientific methods to back up what they are saying.

        A metric of song success, the <i>Billboard Hot 100,</i><app-footnote [id]="5" [pageRoute]="pageRoute"/> started in 1958. This a weekly chart that lists the top 100 most popular songs by U.S. artists. Songs are ranked each week based on total music streaming activity, radio airplay, and sales data. Having a song appear on the chart is a badge of honor and thus it is sought after by many artists. For a smaller artist, it could mean the breakthrough they need to truly start a career in music. It makes sense then that studying the songs on the <i>Billboard Hot 100</i> could be a useful exercise in viral song writing. Those songs made the list for a reason, and while many of the songs on the list are by established artists like rapper Post Malone and singer Sabrina Carpenter, the songs by these artists is popular for a reason. By studying the charts, new artists could find common threads in the top songs and learn from that. This, however, is definitely easier said than done.
