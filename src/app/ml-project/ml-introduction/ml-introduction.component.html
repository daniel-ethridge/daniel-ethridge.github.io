            Millions of people in the world consume to music every day in both digital formats and live. The music industry's revenue was reported to be $28.6 billion at the beginning of 2024<span citation="IFPI Global Music Report 2024" href="https://www.billboard.com/business/business-news/ifpi-global-report-2024-music-business-revenue-market-share-1235637873/"></span>. It is an obvious and ubiquitous part of life, and advancements in the internet and social media are making it easier for both fans to access music and for artists to grow their fanbases<span citation="Utilizing Social Media In The Music Industry" href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2023/09/22/utilizing-social-media-in-the-music-industry/"></span>. For artists, a common dream is often for a song to go viral which can lead to opportunities to transform a simple hobby into a music career. This is, of course, easier said than done. A quick google search for "what makes a viral song" returned a Medium.com article<span citation="The Art of Going Viral Part 1: The Formula of a Viral Song" href="https://medium.com/@Michael_Arty_MPT_Agency/the-art-of-going-viral-part-1-the-formula-of-a-viral-song-aa64174bf99d"></span> that lists "catchiness and relatability", "platform optimization", "emotional or cultural resonance", and "quality and production" as four keys. The author also lists TikTok and Spotify as critical for acheiving virality. Another online article<span citation="Case Study: How Artists and Songs Go Viral" href="https://www.edmprod.com/case-study-how-artists-and-songs-go-viral/"></span> lists marketing, simplicity, and sharability as important factors. The list of articles that describe how to make viral music is endless, but most likely none of them use any kind of scientific methods to back up what they are saying.

            A metric of song success, the <i>Billboard Hot 100,</i><span citation="Billboard Hot 100" href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/"></span> started in 1958. This a weekly chart that lists the top 100 most popular songs by U.S. artists. Songs are ranked each week based on total music streaming activity, radio airplay, and sales data. Having a song appear on the chart is a badge of honor and thus it is sought after by many artists. For a smaller artist, it could mean the breakthrough they need to truly start a career in music. It makes sense then that studying the songs on the <i>Billboard Hot 100</i> could be a useful exercise in viral song writing. Those songs made the list for a reason, and while many of the songs on the list are by established artists like rapper Post Malone and singer Sabrina Carpenter, the songs by these artists is popular for a reason. By studying the charts, new artists could find common threads in the top songs and learn from that. This, however, is definitely easier said than done.

            As alluded to before, truly determining what makes a song catchy or not is not an easy task. There are numerous musical attributes to keep in mind. The tempo of a song, the lyrical content, the energy, the genre, the instrumentation, the balance between instruments, the chord structures, and more all can influence how much a song is enjoyed. Humans innately are not able to wrap their heads around all of this at once, but the information gained from theoretically doing this is enormous.

            In addition to song popularity, the concept of classifying a song or band into a genre is not an easy task. Attempts to do so have even at times led to pushback by various groups. Such as example is the band <em>Sum 41</em>, who several times has been classified as a pop punk group. In response, they have resisted being put into a single genre, responding by saying that they want their sound to be known as them rather than trying to be packaged into a genre. With that being said, genre classification is not something that will go away. It has its own importance and value. Historically, it has been a way for musicologists to group classical music into "genres" of Baroque music, Classical Era music, and Romantic Music. Today it can still be a way for musicians and musicologists to describe the common elements and patterns of particular genres, an important part of music history and study.

            The overarching goal of this project is to learn about common attributes of popular music and to attempt predicting success based on those attributes. Additionally, there are other questions at hand that are common amongst critics, professional and non-professional alike. Many claim that popular music sounds more and more similar and unoriginal each year. Is there are reason for that visible in available data? There is also the question of success accounting for gender. While historically the music industry has been male dominated, to what degree are women and people of other genders receiving opportunities? <br><br>
