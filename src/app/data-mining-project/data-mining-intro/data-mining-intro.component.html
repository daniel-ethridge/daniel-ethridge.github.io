    <h1 style="text-align: center;">A Data Mining Approach for Advice on Surviving the Videogame Industry</h1>
    <p>
        The video game industry is a multi-billion dollar industry, and the evaluation continues to grow each year. Developments in technology have taken us from playing pong on the Atari system to virtual concerts inside of the wildly successful videogame <i>Fortnite</i>. Games such as the massive multiplayer online roleplaying games <i>World of Warcraft</i> and <i>Guild Wars 2</i> allow players to play together and interact with each other in real-time when their geographical location might be thousands of miles apart. Additionally, continued development gave rise to <i>Steam.com</i> which is now the most popular distributor of PC/desktop games. While many of these games are developed by larger companies, the development of video game engines (which allow virtually anyone to make their own game granted they have necessary skills like software development) has led to a rise in independent video game development (or indie games).

    <p>
        The backgrounds of indie game developers varies widely. Some have worked in large professional studios, some have degrees ranging from computer science to game design, and some are gamers that are interested in making their own video games. Skill levels, knowledge levels, and experience vary widely. It follows that some indie developers know the process of building and shipping a full game with the potential of success while others are lost without a roadmap in an already cut-throat and competitive industry. While more and more game development  resources are available on the internet in the forms of written instruction and YouTube.com video content, the backgrounds and expertise of the resource creators is often unknown. Viewers must take caution with instructional content due to potential incorrectness or a lack of best practices in the advice and knowledge presented.

        In the case that the source of information is from a reputable or known source, the breadth of the information shared might be limited. Take the site <i><a href="https://www.steamlytics.com/367520/hollow-knight">Steamlytics.com</a></i> and their entry for the widly popular indie game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/">Hollow Night</a>. <i>Steamlytics</i> provides a sentiment analysis and a high level overview of the overarching response to the game. Information provided includes

        These limitations of current instructional content for video game development could be at least in part supplemented by an in-depth data-driven analysis of factors that may predict the success or failure of a new video game. Such data can be collected from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/"><i>Steam</i></a>. Each game on <i>Steam</i> has associated images, trailers, music, reviews, popularity scores, etc. This data can provide insight into potential reasons for the success or failure of a given video game. It is reasonable to expect that through analyzing thousands of games (on <i>Steam</i>, there are over 200,000), patterns will emerge in terms of the qualities that successful games share, that moderately successful games share, and that failed games share. These patterns could then be interpreted to inform guidelines and instructional content related to video game development. Futhermore, the patterns could be utilized to inform game marketing strategies which is a critical part of game success.
