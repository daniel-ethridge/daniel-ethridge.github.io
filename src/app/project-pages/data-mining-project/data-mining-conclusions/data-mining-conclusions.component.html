        <p>
            Video games are at their core interactive mediums for art. They bring together elements of narrative design, art, music, sound effects, and more. Results showed that a quality story was one of the most appreciated aspects of the video games, and it held a central point in analyses. This makes sense on multiple levels. First, art is largely about telling stories. Songs (with and without lyrics) tell stories to a listener. Theatrical plays and movies show a story acted out. Books create entire world's using a reader's imagination. Humans naturally seek out stories and are drawn to them.

            This raises a question of whether or not stories are more important than the other elements involved. Do art, music, sound, and game mechanics take a back seat? We say no. Without these foundational elements, a story has no support. Take, for example, the massively multiplayer genre, of which games like World of Warcraft and Guild Wars 2 are members. The central word tied to all others is "can't". Obviously a negative word in this context, poor massively multiplayer games were most likely plagued by the player's inability to do something. This would serve as an example of limited player agency or independence. Obviously game developers have to set constraints on what the player can do, but too much of a barrier can leave the game feeling stale. A common idea in video game development (and and various jobs like user experience design, sound, and lighting) is that audience attention should not be fully drawn to these elements. If it is, that is probably a clear sign that something is off. This is because, again, these are often supporting elements adding to a whole. Too much attention drawn to any individual element is distracting from the bigger picture.

            In the realm of art, we showed the potential to translate a static image into a short game description. Art is almost always a game's first impression, and many developers and players have anecdotally stated that art can make or break a game's success. The ability to create a static image and have it automatically labeled then gives a game developer, character artist, environmental artist, or anyone else involved in art production a strong tool to seek out games with similar art styles and be inspired by the genres of these games. Innovation in games often comes from taking inspiration from several other games and merging together unique combinations of mechanics. It is then possible to find significant quantities of inspiration quickly simply by automatically tagging a static frame.

            Additionally in the realm of art, we show a potential link between elements of game art (like saturation and contrast) with game success. Results showed potential optimal levels of contrast and saturation in images. A mid range contrast amount predicted slightly better performance, and higher levels of saturation tended to be indicative of worse performing games.

            This project represents a small part of the potential future analyses that could be completed. Reviews and art represent only a portion of the video game landscape. Music, sound effects, lighting effects, story design, and more all are included in the development process of a game. In the future, further work could be dedicated to integrating more types of data together (eg more metadata, audio, etc.), interaction design analysis, market analytics, and platform specific patterns.
