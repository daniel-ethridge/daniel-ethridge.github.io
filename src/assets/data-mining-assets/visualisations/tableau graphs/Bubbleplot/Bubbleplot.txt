Explanation - 
The bubble plot shows the price vs review sentiment (which is the ratio of positive and negative reviews). The bubble size denotes the value of review sentiment (larger bubble implies positive review). While the colour denotes the price, more red implies more pricey game.

Observations- 
We can observe that more pricey games tend to have more positive review sentiment, and vice versa. Which can be confirmed as less pricey games tend to be made by cheaper indie game developers who cannot make the best of games.
