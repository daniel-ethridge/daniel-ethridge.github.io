I am a musician, a software engineer, and an aspiring university professor. Currently, I am studying towards my PhD in Creative Technology and Design at the ATLAS Institute at the University of Colorado Boulder. 

"Creative Technology and Design? What's that?"

I'm glad you asked.

My interests lie at the intersection of music, physiology, and technology. In my PhD, I am exploring the ways in which technology can employ human physiological signals as inputs into interactive, musical experiences.

Before my PhD, I was working as a research scientist and software developer at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) in the Electro-Optical Systems Laboratory. My work has included machine learning applied to audio signals, front end development using React, and C++ development using the Qt Framework.

Prior to GTRI, I spent two years studying towards a master's degree in Music Technology from Georgia Tech. While there, I studied topics such as music information retrieval, interactive music, game design, and multimedia development. My final project explored musical collaboration in a network music environment. (Check out the projects page to learn more!)

Before Georgia Tech, I completed my undergraduate degree at Brevard College in North Carolina where I completed a double major in mathematics and music. During those four years, I participated in numerous ensembles every semester (jazz ensemble and combo, choir, and wind ensemble). Whether it was singing, playing clarinet, or playing jazz piano, music was around me every day. When I wasn't in rehearsal, you could typically find me studying the latest and greatest from a linear algebra class or helping sound design a play for the theatre department.
