I am a musician, software engineer, and aspiring multimedia artist. I am interested in exploring the ways that music and visual arts can be combined into new and unique interactive experiences. 

I currently work as a research scientist and software developer at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) in the Electro-Optical Systems Laboratory. My work has included machine learning applied to audio signals, front end development using React, and C++ development using the Qt Framework. 

Prior to starting at GTRI, I spent two years studying towards a master's degree in Music Technology from Georgia Tech. While there, I studied topics such as music information retrieval, interactive music, game design, and multimedia development. My final project explored musical collaboration in a network music environment, advised by Dr. Jason Freeman. (Check out the portfolio page to learn more!)

Before my time at Georgia Tech, I completed my undergraduate Education at Brevard College in North Carolina where I successfully completed a double major in mathematics and music. During those four years, I participated in numerous ensembles every semester (jazz ensemble and combo, choir, and wind ensemble). Whether it was singing, playing clarinet, or playing jazz piano, music was around me every day. When I wasn't in rehearsal, you could typically find me studying the latest and greatest from a linear algebra class or helping sound design a play for the theatre department.
